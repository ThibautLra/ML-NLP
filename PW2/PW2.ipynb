      "assume nothing . \n",
      "the phrase is perhaps one of the most used of the 1990's , as first impressions and rumors are hardly ever what they seem to be . \n",
      "the phrase especially goes for oscar novak , an architect who is the main focus of three to tango , a delightful , funny romantic comedy about assumptions and being yourself . \n",
      "novak ( matthew perry ) , a shy , clumsy , chicago based architect , along with openly gay partner , peter steinberg ( oliver platt ) , fights for projects day in and day out . \n",
      "one of these is the job of restoring a popular building for charles newman ( dylan mcdermott ) , a rich , well-known businessman . \n",
      "charles immediately takes a liking to oscar , as he enjoys his personality and sense of humor . \n",
      "seeing oscar as someone he could trust , charles asks him to watch his girlfriend , an unpredictable , adventurous girl named amy post ( neve campbell ) , who makes a living by blowing glass . \n",
      "charles wants to know who she talks to , what she does , and where she goes . \n",
      "the point ? \n",
      "to make sure she's not seeing someone else , of course . \n",
      "oscar gladly takes the job , and meets amy at an art show of hers , and sparks fly between the two from the get go . \n",
      "oscar feels he has found the one meant for him , and he is content with the idea of being with amy . \n",
      "well , another popular phrase of the 90's is \" all good things must come to an end , \" and this stays true for oscar as well . \n",
      "charles walks in on amy and oscar having a drink one night , as oscar and amy have become great friends , but he doesn't seem to mind . \n",
      "why is this ? \n",
      "he thinks oscar is gay . \n",
      "he's not afraid to share this with him either . \n",
      "oscar stands in shock after the words , \" i swear if you weren't gay oscar , i'd have to kill you , \" are muttered flamboyantly from charles' mouth . \n",
      "the word spreads instantly through town . \n",
      "will oscar \" come out \" of his supposed gayness , or will he tell everyone that he isn't ? \n",
      "one would immediately think he would deny the fact , but numerous occurrences come to oscar , which result in the fact that if he denies the fact , he could lose his job with charles . \n",
      "matthew perry doesn't escape his character as chandler on the already classic t . v . \n",
      "comedy \" friends , \" as both oscar novak and chandler are clueless , shy , and sensitive . \n",
      "nonetheless , perry is hilarious here , and shows that he can handle drama , as obviously , his character suffers quite a bit here . \n",
      "it's wonderful to see neve campbell outside of a horror movie , ( she was the star of scream 1 and 2 , and the upcoming scream 3 ) as she handles comedy superbly here . \n",
      "her voice , smile , and personality are more than perfect for romantic comedies- stay with this genre , neve . \n",
      "neve is delightful as her conflicted character , who feels love for oscar , but knows , based on rumors , that he is gay . \n",
      "as usual , campbell is likable as her likable character . \n",
      "unlike the other two leads here , dylan mcdermott is flat in his dialogue , and is never convincing . \n",
      "when his character his present , mcdermott sets a dull tone to the scene with his horrible acting . \n",
      "stick to the t . v . \n",
      "drama , the practice , dylan . \n",
      "the major weak spot in three to tango is the direction of damon santostefano . \n",
      "no originality or technique is used whatsoever . \n",
      "three to tango is lucky that the script is so edgy and that perry and campbell are wonderful in comedy , or else the film would have been a disaster , as it is just plain boring to look at . \n",
      "three to tango is a film done many times before , as the plot is suspiciously close to 1998's the object of my affection , but the plot has never been completed so well . \n",
      "three to tango's script , written by rodney patrick vaccaro and aline brosh mckenna is fun , fast , and funny , delivering not only original , hilarious gay jokes ( not your run of the mill material ) , but a certain snappiness in the dialogue between characters that always keeps you smiling . \n",
      "unlike last summer's south park : bigger , longer , and uncut and 1997's in & out , three to tango is a comedy in which the gay element is not crude or vulgar . \n",
      "the script is wise to take this route , as gays can't ( i don't think so , anyway ) be offended by this light , playful comedy . \n",
      " ( to prove this , a gay couple was in the audience who were laughing constantly . ) \n",
      "three to tango's climax is a hilarious , clever scene that is pure irony based on the outcome of most romantic-mistaken identity comedies . \n",
      "three to tango is a gem . \n",
      "the bottom line : three to tango is a light , sharp , snappy romantic comedy with a superb ending , and great stars . \n",

      "other than director russ meyer's predilection for casting attractive large breasted women who ultimately expose the afore-mentioned anatomical areas , there is really only one other reason to recommend even taking a look at this movie . \n",
      "that is the fact that it was co-written by famed film critic roger ebert , who also was responsible for the screenplay . \n",
      "after watching this movie you will never be able to sit through another one of his reviews where he gives a movie a thumbs down for bad writing with a straight face . \n",
      "this movie stinks out loud . \n",
      "quite frankly , this movie deserves a . \n",
      "but there are parts of it that are so bad they are almost funny . \n",
      "so i'm giving it a . \n",
      "and maybe that is too generous . \n",
      "right from the opening credits , i knew that i had a class-a bomb on my hands . \n",
      "not only are the way the credits actually shot distracting , but the first scene you see includes a big breasted young woman being chased by a guy in a nazi uniform . \n",
      "i had absolutely no idea why the hell that was happening ( it does get explained later ) and as soon as the first scene is over , we cut to a completely unrelated scene . \n",
      "to be honest , as i sat through this movie mesmerized by just how incredibly awful it was , i actually forgot about the seemingly out of place opening until it popped up again later in the film . \n",
      "with the quality of the writing during the rest of the film , it wouldn't have surprised me if the opening had never been explained . \n",
      "so what is this movie about ? \n",
      "you ask . \n",
      "like it really matters . \n",
      "ok , here goes . \n",
      "this all-girl band headed by kelly macnamara ( dolly reed ) and her friends go to hollywood to try to gain a foothold in the music industry . \n",
      "once there , they do manage to find success ( due as much to their hooters as anything else ? it sure wasn't for their brutally bad singing voices ) , and the movie chronicles how their lives change for the worse as the pressures of fame get to them . \n",
      "everything from big egos , to booze and drugs to free flowing sex sends them on a downward spiral . \n",
      "there are a couple of other idiotic subplots thrown in for good measure , but the fame is the one that pretty much sums up this thing . \n",
      ">from a creative standpoint there is nothing redeeming here . \n",
      "other than the above-mentioned obsession with big knockers that russ meyer seemed to have . \n",
      "the dialogue is so incredibly bad that it literally is funny in parts . \n",
      "mr . ebert has generously thrown in helpings of \" hey man \" , \" dig \" and my all time favorite -- \" this is my happening , and it freaks me out \" . \n",
      "now i ask you , with lines like that how can you go wrong ? \n",
      "ebert had tried to inject as many big words as possible into the dialogue . \n",
      "maybe he thought it would make the movie seem smarter . \n",
      "i don't know , but all the big words in the world wouldn't be able to disguise the bad writing and even worse acting . \n",
      "but the wretched dialogue goes along well with the wretched quality of everything else in this movie . \n",
      "i've seen home movies directed better than meyer managed with this turkey . \n",
      "in fact , there is one scene -- the one in which they are in a van driving to hollywood to make their fortunes -- during which i really had to question if meyer or his editors had just suffered serious head injuries . \n",
      "add to the directing and writing the music in this movie . \n",
      "i almost got up to check my sound system to see if it was broken , there was such a pile of crap emanating from the speakers . \n",
      "then we have the cast . \n",
      "first lets start david gurian who played harris , the manager of the band . \n",
      "this has got to be the goofiest looking guy that has ever set foot in front of a motion picture camera . \n",
      "sadly , his acting doesn't come close to making up for his looks . \n",
      "if you have been following along up to this point , this shouldn't surprise you . \n",
      "meyer's stable of well endowed girls also have the benefit of being fairly attractive to go along with their other assets . \n",
      "dolly reed plays kelly , the leader of the band . \n",
      "and no surprise here , she was cast for her cup size , not her talents . \n",
      "and yes , she does loose the shirt a few times and display her impressive talents . \n",
      "sadly , her ass is almost as large as her chest . \n",
      "hey , it a sexist movie , so i'm writing a sexist review . \n",
      "then we have former playboy playmate cynthia myers in a fairly small role as casey , one of the other band members . \n",
      "this goes along with the rest of the idiotic thinking in the movie . \n",
      "meyer casts a gorgeous playmate with a rack to kill for and who obviously has no acting talent at all , but her nude scenes are the biggest disappointment of all . \n",
      "sure russ , now is the time to get artsy and throw in some well placed shadows . \n",
      "on the up side , she does have a fun lesbo scene . \n",
      "i sound like i'm writing a review in a porn magazine . \n",
      "but hey , i'll admit it ; the only reason that i actually managed to sit through this damn movie was to catch a look at cynthia myers naked . \n",
      "and since that was a huge disappointment , i pretty much wasted two hours of my life on this turkey . \n",
      "the only thing that i can say about this movie is that you should stay away from it . \n",
      "unless of course you want to feel good about yourself by knowing that even a pulitzer prize winning film critic like roger ebert has screwed up at least once in his life too . \n",
      "and if you are thinking of checking it out for the double d's -- you are better off just downloading nude cynthia myers pictures off the internet . \n",
      "this is a movie that should be avoided at all costs . \n",
      "an even better idea might be to require video stores to place a warning on the box of beyond the valley of the dolls -- beware : this movie is extremely hazardous to your common sense . \n",
